Simple Javascript web page to allow a user to select from 4 EV models( Bolt EUV(65kWh), ID.4(82kWh), Leaf(40kWh), Telsa MYLR(81kWh) )
then enter the current battery State of Charge( SOC ) as a percent( 0-100 ).
then compute the kWh of charge needed to get to 80% SOC or change the charge limit SOC and calculate the kWh needed to charge to that target charge limit.

Gemini:
generate javascript web page for use on my WordPress hosted web page which accepts current SOC and calculates the number of kilowatt hours(kWh) needed to charge the 65kWh battery to 80% SOC.

generate javascript web page for which accepts current SOC for a Bolt EV having a 65 kWh battery or an ID.4 EV having a 82 kWh battery and calculates the number of kilowatt hours(kWh) needed to charge the battery to 80% SOC. Make the returned number and label H2 size and bold.

only make the number and kWh label size H2 and bold.
